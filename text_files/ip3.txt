Write a JavaScript that returns (and writes) the title of one of the Web pages somewhere on that page.
    <ul style="color:white">
    <li>Each webpage (including this one) calls a script that I wrote that takes what is written in the TITLE element and writes it into the webpage as the header.</li>
    </ul>
Write a JavaScript that returns (and writes) the URL of one of the Web pages somewhere on that page.
    <ul style="color:white">
    <li>Each webpage (including this one) calls a script that I wrote that gets the URL of each page and writes it into the footer (not included if viewing on a screen less than 1200px).</li>
    </ul>
<br />
Write a JavaScript that returns (and writes) the date and time that each Web page was modified somewhere on that page.
    <ul style="color:white">
    <li>Each webpage (including this one) calls a script that I wrote that gets date that each page was last modified and writes it into the footer (not included if viewing on a screen less than 1200px).</li>
    </ul>
<br />
Write 3 more useful JavaScripts that refer to the JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM), and add those scripts to the respective Web pages.
    <ol style="color:white">
    <li>Each collection page (whether HTML or XSL) calls a script that I wrote that determines what collection is being viewed, determines the corresponding XML document, creates a new SPAN element, and displays the information in the DESCRIPTION element of the proper XML document in the description section of the page.</li><br />
    <li>The index page has a button to view updates made to this site. When clicked it calls a function that I wrote to display an alert that lists the key updates made to this site.</li><br />
    <li>The third script adds an Image Carousel to the Home Page that displays four different pictures that my daughter drew in a revolving carousel.</li><br />
    <li>You are reading the fourth script. This information is written on a .txt document. I wrote a function that loads this data into the page that you are currently on. A few HTML tags were thrown into the document just for a little formatting. This assignment was more fun than I thought it would be.</li>
    </ol>
